This repos contains payload formatters for known sensors. It is used in the TTN stack to format uplink packages from a sensor. 

Disclaimer: I did not write these formatters myself, and can therefore not help with the specifics of the calculations. I mearly put functions together so that a single file contains everything that needs to be copied to an end-devices uplink payload formatter.
